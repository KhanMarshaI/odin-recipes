    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1> <br>
    <p>Hello World! In this project we will be creating a website for recipes!</p>
    <p>The aim of this project is to create at least three different webpages for three different recipes!</p>
    <p>Since I am a desi guy the first recipe will be Biryani, which on eating will make you feel like you are eating some God sent food!</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="./recipes/biryani.html" title="Biryani Recipe">Biryani</a></li>
    <li><a href="./recipes/loaded.html">Loaded Pizza Fries</a></li>
    </ul>
