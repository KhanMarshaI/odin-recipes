    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

    <h2>Steps to make Chicken Thighs</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray foil with cooking spray.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>Arrange chicken thighs, skin-side up, on the prepared baking sheet.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>Combine garlic salt, onion salt, oregano, thyme, paprika, and pepper in a small bowl; mix until well combined. Sprinkle spice mixture liberally over chicken thighs.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
        <p>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until skin is crispy, thighs are no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
    </ol>
