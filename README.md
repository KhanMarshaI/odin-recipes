I will be creating a website for recipes using only HTML which will contain an index page and links (of course the links will be relative) to a few recipes. 
The first step will include creating a boilerplate and then actually creating a structure for the index page.
We will then move on to creating structure for recipe pages.
For this project I will be using the following HTML elements.
<!-- <h1>, <p>, <img>, <a>, <title>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>.  -->
